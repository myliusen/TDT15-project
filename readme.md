# Yield Curve Factor Extraction: PCA vs. Autoencoders

This project explores various methods for extracting latent factors from the Treasury yield curve. It compares traditional finance methods (Principal Component Analysis) against modern machine learning techniques (Linear Autoencoders, Deep Nonlinear Autoencoders, and Variational Autoencoders).

Finally, the project evaluates the predictive power of these extracted factors by regressing them against the excess returns of 10-year Treasury bonds.

## Project Structure

The analysis is divided into a sequential series of Jupyter Notebooks:

*   **0EDA.ipynb**: Exploratory Data Analysis. Visualizes yield curves, 3D surface plots of yields over time, summary statistics, and correlation heatmaps.
*   **1PCA.ipynb**: Performs deterministic Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on yield levels. Regresses PCA factors against FRED-MD macro factors.
*   **2AE_PCA.ipynb**: Implements a Linear Autoencoder (AE) to demonstrate the theoretical equivalence between Linear AE + SVD and PCA.
*   **2bAE_PCA.ipynb**: Implements a Deep Nonlinear Autoencoder. Visualizes the latent manifold to show how latent factors affect the slope, level, and curvature of the yield curve non-linearly.
*   **3aVAE.ipynb**: Implements a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using PyTorch with KL-divergence annealing. Includes uncertainty quantification (confidence bands) for the latent factors. 3b2DVAE and 3c5DVAE are largely copies of 3aVAE to compute scores for 2D- and 5D-factor models. 
*   **4ExcessReturns.ipynb**: Financial evaluation. Runs predictive regressions (OLS) of 10-year excess returns on the factors extracted from all four models (PCA, Linear AE, Deep AE, VAE) to compare in-sample fit ($R^2$).
